## Typester Development

*Before jumping into the documentation it maybe be worthwhile reading through this document
thoroughly.*

Typester is architected in a manner that may not be what you're used it, some might
even say its architecture is non-standard. The primary reason is that we used this
project as an opportunity to experiment with 'alternative' architectural patterns.

Although we do feel that the way we've laid everything out, and how everything
interacts within the system should be quite intuitive.
