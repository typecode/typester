                <h2>A simple to use <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> text editor, inspired by Medium and <a href='https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor' target='_blank'>Medium Editor</a>, that produces clean and predictable <strong>HTML</strong> from your user's input.</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Flexible, fast, &amp; fabulous</b></p>
                        <p>We&apos;ve worked diligently to make sure that Typester is a robust editor that is flexible, powerful, and&mdash; above all&mdash; simple. We have designed it to do what it's meant to do, do it well, and then stay out of the way.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>No unused code here</b></p>
                        <p>Typester has been designed to be lean, both in byte size and resource consumption. Typester has only one third party dependency, <a href='https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify' target='_blank'>DOMPurify</a>. Every other code requirement, from DOM traversal and manipulation to event handling, was developed bespoke for this package.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Engineered for modern modules</b></p>
                        <p>Typester has been created using ES6+ JavaScript module patterns, which means you need only import it and instantiate it. If you still prefer <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> imports that's fine too; Typester will bind itself to the global scope allowing you to <code>new window.Typester({ /* options */ })</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Minimal DOM footprint</b></p>
                        <p>Typester won&apos;t clutter your pristine markup with multiple DOM injections for each editor instance. Need multiple editors on a single page? No problem, Typester will inject single instances of its DOM requirements which will be shared between the editors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Single file import (batteries included)</b></p>
                        <p>No need to import separate stylesheets and additional dependencies. Typester comes with everything it needs rolled into one JS file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Pure XSS-free DOM powered by <a href='https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify' target='_blank'>DOMPurify</a></b></p>
                        <p>Typester, thanks to the awesome power of DOMPurify, will ensure that the HTML you receive is sanitized against
                        XSS exploits.</p>
