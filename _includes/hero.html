                    A simple to use <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> text editor inspired by Medium and Medium Editor that gives you clean and predictable <strong>HTML</strong> from your user's input.

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Flexible, fast, &amp; fabulous</b></p>
                        <p>We&apos;ve worked diligently to make sure that Typester is a robust editor that is flexible, powerful, and above all simple. We have designed it to do what its meant to do, do it well, and then stay out of the way.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>No unused code here</b></p>
                        <p>Typester has been designed to be as lean as possible, both in size and resource consumption. Typester has only one third party dependency, DOMPurify. Every other code requirement, from DOM traversal and manipulation to event handling, was developed bespoke for this package.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Engineered for modern modules</b></p>
                        <p>Typester has been created using ES6+ JavaScript module patterns which means you need only import it and instantiate it. If you still prefer <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> imports that's fine too Typester will bind itself to the global scope allowing you to <code>new window.Typester({ /* options */ })</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Minimal DOM footprint</b></p>
                        <p>It won&apos;t clutter your beautifully laid out markup with multiple DOM injections for each editor instance. Need multiple editors on a single page? No problem, typester will inject single instances of its DOM requirements which will be shared between the editors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Single file import (batteries included)</b></p>
                        <p>No need to import separate stylesheets and additional dependencies. Typester comes with everything it needs rolled into one JS file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <p>Typester, thanks to the awesome power of DOMPurify, will give
                        make sure that the HTML you receive is sanitized against
                        XSS exploits.</p>
